Hi there, I am Wenting Wang 王文婷. I am working as a research assistant at MPI  Biological Cybernetics and Tuebingen Hospital Dept. Psychiatry, meanwhile studying in the graduate school of Neural Information Processing at the University Tuebingen.

My research focuses on mechanisms on brain functions and dysfunctions - from computational neuroscience perspectives. I use bayesian and reinforcement learning methods to model the information processing in the brains, with decision making and neuroimaging data. I am passionate about broad questions in cognitive and neuroscience, improvisational music(flute, guitar) and travel around.
