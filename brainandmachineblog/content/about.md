Hi there, I am Wenting Wang. I am a master student in the Graduate School of Neural Information Processing at the University Tuebingen, meanwhile working as a research assistant at Siemens Imaging Center at the University Hospital.

My research focuses on mechanisms on brain functions and dysfunctions - from computational neuroscience perspectives. I use neuroimaging data and machine learning and bayesian statistics as a model system. I am passionate about broad questions in cognitive and neuroscience, improvisational music(flute, guitar) and dance(picking up tribal dance recently). Never said no to tea.
